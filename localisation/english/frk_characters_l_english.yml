  country_leader_harald_dede_desc: "Kaiser Harold has ruled the German lands with an iron fist for over two decades. His unification of the nation came through war, coercion, and political purges that silenced dissent. While he maintained order and kept the Kaiserreich stable, his reign has been marked by repression, censorship, and the ruthless elimination of opposition. Now in his seventies, age and illness have begun to slow him, leaving the once-dominant ruler a weakened figure presiding over a nation built on fear."
